# WorldFair Connect

A hack-together social graph for conference attendeesâ€”built on Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel.

At the AI World Fair, attendees can sign up, record key takeaways, link ideas to speakers, and connect with others. All data feeds into a distributed "memory"/RAG system over talk transcripts.
